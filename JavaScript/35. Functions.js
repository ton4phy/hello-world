// Exercise
// Sam counted the number of enemy soldiers in the twin towers and accidentally confused the signs of operations.
// His calculations were correct, not counting the fact that the result was negative.
// Help Sam find the modulus of the number of fighters. 
// Display the modulus of the number located in the soldiersCount variable using the Math.abs function.

const soldiersCount = -2309;

// BEGIN
console.log(Math.abs(soldiersCount));
// END
