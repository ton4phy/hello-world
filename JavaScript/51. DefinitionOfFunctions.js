// Exercise
// Implement the printJaimesLine function, which takes one argument, a string, and displays a replica on the screen in the JAIME format: passed_string.

// How to name a variable that will be an argument - decide for yourself.

// Our system contains code hidden from you. In this exercise, the function call printJaimesLine is hidden. 
// So we check your decision.

// You do not need to call the function yourself, just define it. But for clarity, this is how our system calls it:

// printJaimesLine ('Farewell, my friend ...');

// BEGIN
const printJaimesLine = (text) => {
  console.log(`JAIME: ${text}`);
};
// END

module.exports = printJaimesLine;
