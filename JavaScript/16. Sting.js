// Exercises
// Write a program that displays:

// - Did Joffrey agree?
// - He did. He also said "I love using \ n".

// In this case, the program uses only one console.log, 
// but the result on the screen should look exactly as shown above.

console.log('- Did Joffrey agree?\n- He did. He also said "I love using \\n".');
