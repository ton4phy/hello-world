# Exercise
# In Python, you can "request" and display any character from the ASCII encoding. For example:

# print (chr (63))
# The symbol with the number 63 is displayed on the screen - a question mark?. In this way, you can display any character.

# Find the ASCII code table on the Internet. You can use queries like “ascii codes table” or “ascii codes”.
# Usually in such tables, codes are indicated in several numeral systems at once: decimal, binary, octal,
# and hexadecimal. We are interested in decimal code (dec or decimal).

# Using the example above and the table found, display (each on its own line) ~, ^ and%.

print(chr(126))
print(chr(94))
print(chr(37))
