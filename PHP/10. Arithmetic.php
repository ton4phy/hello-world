// Exercise
// Implement a program that calculates the value of the expression 8/2 + 5 - -3 / 2.
// Do not calculate anything yourself, your program should do all the calculations itself.

// Note that the interpreter performs arithmetic calculations in the correct order: 
// first, division and multiplication, then addition and subtraction.

<?php

// BEGIN
print_r(8 / 2 + 5 - -3 / 2);
// END
