// Exercise
// Write a program that displays:

// - Did Joffrey agree?
// - He did. He also said "I love using \ n".
// In this case, the program uses only one print_r, but the result on the screen should look exactly as shown above.

<?php

// BEGIN
print_r("- Did Joffrey agree?\n- He did. He also said \"I love using \\n\".");
// END
