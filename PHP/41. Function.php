// Exercise
// Implement the printJaimesLine function, which takes one argument,
// a string, and displays a replica on the screen in the JAIME format: passed_string.
// How to name a variable that will be an argument - decide for yourself.
// Our system contains code hidden from you. In this exercise,
// the function call printJaimesLine is hidden. So we check your decision.
// You do not need to call the function yourself, just define it. But for clarity, this is how our system calls it:

// printJaimesLine ("Farewell, my friend ...");

<?php

// BEGIN
function printJaimesLine($text)
{
    print_r("JAIME: {$text}");
}
// END
