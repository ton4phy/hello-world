// Exercise
// Now it's your turn to look at the function signature in the documentation and figure out how to use it. 
// You can read the documentation in Russian, but the programmer must be able to read the documentation in English. 
// Use dictionaries or translators if necessary.
// It is better to immediately get used to and tighten up reading skills in English, 
// otherwise there will be difficulties in the future.

// PHP has a ucfirst function. Check out her signature at http://php.net/manual/ru/function.ucfirst.php.

// Write a program that uses the ucfirst function with the $ text variable and displays the result on the screen.

<?php

$text = 'mount';

// BEGIN
print_r(ucfirst($text));
// END
